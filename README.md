### Learning python, let's go to start with this building a basic client/server socket.

#### Start server (listening in port 8000):
```
python socket_srv.py
```

#### Run client and send messages (the connection wil be closed when a empty message is sent):
```
python socket_cli.py
```

#### Environment:
```
Linux Mint 19.3
Python 3.6.8
```
